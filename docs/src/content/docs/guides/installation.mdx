## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

## Choose Your Package

Three packages are provided that you can use independently or together:

- **@dicedhq/gamma** - TypeScript client for the Gamma (market data) API
- **@dicedhq/polymarket** - Polymarket client combining both CLOB and Gamma APIs

<InstallPackage pkg="@dicedhq/polymarket viem" />

### What's Included
